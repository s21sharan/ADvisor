        We've mapped your ad to <span className="font-semibold text-blue-700">{societyCount} high-resonance artificial societies</span>â€”networked buyer micro-communities with shared incentives, pain points, and influence patterns.

        These aren't generic personas. Each society is a simulated culture that will stress-test your creative before you spend a dollar on reach. We're about to run agent-based simulations to show you how each group will talk about your ad, share it (or ignore it), and what messaging will actually make them convert.
