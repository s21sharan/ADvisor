# Keyword Extraction Improvements

## Problem
Initial keyword extraction was pulling generic, meaningless words:
```
Top keywords: ['aita', 'about', 'years', 'after', 'update', 'dont', 'year',
              'their', 'over', 'tifu']
```

These are:
- Reddit jargon (aita, tifu, update)
- Common stopwords (about, after, their, over)
- Generic time words (years, year)
- Contractions (dont)

## Solution

### 1. Comprehensive Stopword List
Expanded from ~60 to **180+ stopwords** covering:

**Common English stopwords**
- Articles, prepositions, conjunctions
- Pronouns, possessives
- Common verbs (be, have, do, etc.)

**Time/quantity words** (too generic)
- years, months, weeks, days, hours
- ago, old, first, second, last, next

**Reddit-specific jargon**
- aita, tifu, update, edit, deleted, removed
- redditor, comment, thread, karma, meta

**Vague/generic verbs**
- dont, need, know, like, got, make, tell, ask, say, try
- going, doing, having, found, telling, started, wanted

**Generic descriptors**
- people, today, every, never, really, still, finally
- right, wrong, around, almost, again

### 2. Stricter Filtering Criteria

```python
if (len(word) >= 5 and                              # At least 5 characters
    word not in stopwords and                       # Not a stopword
    any(c in word for c in 'aeiou') and            # Contains vowel
    not word.isdigit()):                           # Not purely numeric
```

**Changes from before:**
- Minimum length: 3 → **5 characters** (more meaningful)
- Must contain vowel (filters acronyms/abbreviations)
- Numeric filter (removes years, counts)

## Results

```

## Impact on Interest Generation

These meaningful keywords will generate much better interests:

**Before** (with generic keywords):
- "Time Management" (from "years")
- "Updates & News" (from "update")
- "General Discussion" (from "about")

**After** (with meaningful keywords):
- "Fitness & Weight Management" (from "weight", "workout", "running")
- "Relationships & Family" (from "husband", "family", "parents")
- "Education & Career" (from "school", "college", "company")
- "Health & Wellness" (from "health", "sleep", "eating")
- "Home & Design" (from "house", "design")
