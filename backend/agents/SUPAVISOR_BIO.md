## Medium Bio (Agent Marketplace)
SupaVisor is a cloud-hosted coordinator agent on Fetch.ai's Agentverse that bridges user applications with 932 distributed persona agents. It orchestrates multi-persona ad analysis, aggregates responses, and extracts key sentiment metrics for marketing insights. Each persona is powered by Fetch.ai ASI:One API and represents authentic perspectives from real Reddit community data.

## Long Bio (Documentation)
**SupaVisor** is an intelligent coordinator agent deployed on Fetch.ai's Agentverse platform, serving as the middleware layer for AdVisor's distributed persona agent system.

**What it does**: SupaVisor receives ad analysis requests from user applications, forwards them to 932 persona agents hosted on AWS EC2, aggregates individual responses, extracts sentiment breakdowns, and generates comprehensive summaries with key insights for simulation dashboards.

**How it works**: When a user submits an ad description, SupaVisor communicates with the AWS FastAPI backend, triggering parallel execution of N personas (1-932). Each persona agent, powered by Fetch.ai's ASI:One API (asi1-mini model), analyzes the ad from its unique perspective based on real Reddit community data. SupaVisor collects all responses, calculates sentiment distribution (positive/neutral/negative), extracts representative insights, and returns a structured analysis.

**Why it matters**: By decoupling the orchestration layer from execution, SupaVisor enables scalable, cloud-based coordination of hundreds of AI agents while maintaining high availability through Agentverse's managed infrastructure. This architecture allows frontend applications to easily integrate authentic, multi-perspective ad feedback without managing complex agent infrastructure.

**Key capabilities**:
- Handles 1-932 persona requests in parallel
- Sub-5-second response times for typical 10-persona analyses
- Automatic sentiment aggregation and statistical summaries
- Real-time insights extraction from diverse audience perspectives
- 24/7 availability on Agentverse cloud platform

**Data source**: All personas are generated from 10,043+ Reddit posts across 1,577 communities, ensuring authentic, data-driven perspectives rather than synthetic simulations.
